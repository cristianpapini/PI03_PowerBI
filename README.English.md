## Context
MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) have revolutionized the world of education since the beginning of the last decade, when Professor Sebastian Thrun began streaming his introductory course on Artificial Intelligence online. Shortly after, Thrun founded Udacity and over the years other platforms such as edX and Coursera have been added, providing similar services: access to specific, quality content in a practical way, from the comfort of home. Many of these platforms have free content while the general business model is based either on paying recurring subscriptions for general access or one-time subscriptions to access certifications or premium courses. With the increase in popularity of MOOCs, not only have new private platforms like the ones mentioned above appeared, but also many universities and non-profit organizations have added to the offer, making the market much more competitive. In this context, it is imperative for each platform to adjust their business models, the courses and the content offered in them in order to attract and retain the largest number of customers.
  
## Workplan
  To begin the analysis, we proceeded to read and process the datasets from the Coursera, Udemy, and EDX academies. They have different amounts of columns each and different information from each other. Among these are URLs, titles, ratings, reviews, languages, etc.
  During processing, columns that do not add added value to the understanding of the business were removed from them, duplicate and empty columns were eliminated
  For more details about how these stages were step by step, go to the NoteBook that is in the archives.
Finally, once all the datasets have been processed, they are taken to Power BI in order to make an informative-comparative Dashboard. The latter is an excellent tool used to analyze and display the business process through graphs, tables, and KPIs.
